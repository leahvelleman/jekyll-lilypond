# jekyll-lilypond

## Usage

### Syntax

The block expects its contents to be lilypond code, and it compiles that code to produce an image, which it inserts into the rendered page.

These tag attributes are inserted into rendered page:
TODO: class, style, alt, what else?

TODO autogenerated filename

### Output

TODO 

### Templates

You can provide an _output template_ for the tag's appearance on the rendered page. You could use this, for instance, to TODO. 
This template can use any tag attributes, not just the official ones. If your template includes `{{ foo }}`, you can provide 
a value by calling `{% lilypond template: mytemplate foo: bar %}` and it will render to `bar` in the final page. Output templates 
must have a filename ending in `.html`.

You can also provide an _input template_ for the lilypond input, ETC ETC. Input templates must have a filename ending in `.ly`, and must
render to valid lilypond code. 

Input and output templates can access the same attributes. For instance, you could have a `key` attribute that's used by a line like
this in an input template

```
\key {{ key }} major {{ content }}
```

output template

```
<figcaption>Example in {{ key }} major</figcaption>
```

#### Template limitations

TODO handling of `content` and `filename`

## Testing

`bundle exec rspec` runs tests. A minimal sample Jekyll site for tests to call on is in `spec/fixtures`, 
with the interesting details being the sample templates in `spec/fixtures/layouts`.
